# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

## For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:

* Never forget a test

## Resources
### Read or watch:

* doctest — Test interactive Python examples (until “26.2.3.7. Warnings” included)
* doctest – Testing through documentation
* Unit Tests in Python
* Unittest module
* Interactive and Non-interactive tests

# Python Test Cases

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files should end with a new line
* All your test files should be inside a folder tests
* All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
* All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)')
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
* We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case – The Checker is checking for tests!
